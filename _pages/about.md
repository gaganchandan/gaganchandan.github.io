Hey there! My name is Gagan and I'm an 18 year old from Bengaluru, India. I love studying **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. I'm broadly interested in **Software Security** and **Programming Languages**. Specifically, I'm interested in [**Program Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis), [**Formal Methods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) and [**Software Testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) and aim to do research on the same. I regularly play [**CTFs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) where I focus on [**Binary Exploitation**](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/) and [**Reverse Engineering**](https://ctf101.org/reverse-engineering/overview/). I'm also passionate about [**Free and Open-Source Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

In my spare time, I enjoy hopping between Linux distros. I also love playing and watching football. I indulge in online chess as well.
