Hey there! My name is Gagan and I'm a 21 year old from Bengaluru, India. I'm a third year undergraduate student at [PES University](https://pes.edu/) studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about the use of rigorous mathematical techniques to reason about computer programs and their properties, and the use of computational tools to explore mathematical concepts. As such, my interests mainly lie in the field of **Programming Languages** and span areas like [**Program Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis), [**Formal Methods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), [**Theorem Proving**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), [**Functional Programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [**Type Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory). I'm also enthusiastic about [**Free and Open-Source Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

In my spare time, I enjoy playing and watching football. I also love to play video games.
