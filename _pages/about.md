Hey there! My name is Gagan and I'm a 20 year old from Bengaluru, India. I'm a third year undergraduate student at [PES University](https://pes.edu/) studying Computer Science and Engineering. My interests mainly lie in the field of **Programming Languages** and span areas like [**Program Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis), [**Formal Methods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), [**Theorem Proving**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), [**Functional Programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [**Type Theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory). I sometimes dabble in **Software Security** and occasionally play [**CTFs**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)>) where I focus on [**Binary Exploitation**](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/) and [**Reverse Engineering**](https://ctf101.org/reverse-engineering/overview/). I'm also passionate about [**Free and Open-Source Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

In my spare time, I enjoy hopping between Linux distros. I also love playing and watching football.
